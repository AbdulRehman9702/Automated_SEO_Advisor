This book is the first one to document normalization from its origins in Scandinavian services to the mentally retarded to its implications to the field of human services. The National Institute on Mental Retardation has published this text to support the current growing interest in normalization concepts and fuller integration of the retarded into the community. This concept is currently having a major impact on the pattern of programming in a number of countries. The views expressed in this book do not neces­sarily reflect the Institute's specific strategies, or those of its sponsor, the Canadian Association for the Mentally Retarded.
The publication of The principle of normalization in human services, and earlier of Mental retardation • the law • guardianship and Standards for educators of exceptional children in Canada are examples of the Institute's recently established publishing policy to bring to the attention of a wider public new concepts, innovative programs and reports of studies by the Institute itself and by others in the field of the mentally handicapped and in human services generally.",1375,8398,DigitalCommons@UNMC,19,Updated US and Canadian Normalization Factors for TRACI 2.1,59,786,183.0,47976,10944,786,183.0,4.295,1.52,65,51,0,10,9,0,1.674,2,2,4,4,2,3

We’ve been expertly engineering men’s shoes ever since, our legendary walking shoes for men. Today we keep creating men’s with sporty comfort, so dressing up feels as good as dressing down. Walking Shoes for Men A hallmark of Rockport comfort is how we craft shoes from the ground up. By doing so, we offer the best walking shoes for men—and we’re not about to slow down now. Whether it’s our iconic walking shoes, or casual dress shoes for commuting, we provide supportive, long-lasting shoes. You’ll feel the Rockport difference from the very first step of the day to the last. Men’s Summer Shoes When things heat up, you’ll want to turn to men’s summer shoes, no matter what the calendar says. Think  trekkers, loafers and even for the fairway. We expertly craft each style with all-day comfort that you can feel from the first step—no break-in period needed. You’ll find options of walking shoes for men, as well as leather sandals for men, in extended widths too. Men’s Wide Shoes We take fit seriously, because if a shoe the fits, wear it… and wear it comfortably all day long. Whether it’s sneakers, suede or leather shoes for men, or waterproof boots, we’re committed to offering narrow, wide, or extra-wide widths whenever possible.

She interviews the'Who's Who' in parenting and child development, using a framework that helps families to apply new ideas that fit with their own values. With 190+ episodes covering everything from how to get your kids to eat more vegetables, Why we shouldn't read the Your X-Year-Old Child books anymore, to various topics at the intersection of race and parenting, Your Parenting Mojo has been downloaded 3+ million times worldwide and has evolved to include workshops, ongoing memberships and more to support parents' needs, and children's learning and development. Jen's popular 10 week Taming Your Triggers workshop (opens in Spring and Autumn) helps parents figure out how to stop being triggered by their child's age appropriate behavior and parent from a place of calm, clarity and confidence. For those looking to bring many of the tools and strategies discussed in the podcast into their own home and families, Jen's Parenting Membership (opens in late Spring) helps parents support their child's development while also making parenting easier. And for those parents looking to support their children's intrinsic love of learning, Jen's Learning Membership (opens in Autumn) helps keep children's intrinsic curiosity and motivation intact. In September of 2023, in partnership with Sasquatch Books & Penguin Random House, Jen launched her first book - Parenting Beyond Power: How to Use Connection & Collaboration to Transform Your Family - And the World - that describes practical tools parents can use to raise children who will change the world tomorrow - while also making family life easier today. The book traces the ways that social forces like White supremacy (including racism), patriarchy, and capitalism have hurt us - and how we will pass those hurts on to our children unless we make a conscious decision to do something differently. The book shows step-by-step how to both understand and meet our children's needs and our own needs so we can all live fulfilled lives - making it easier to get out the door in the morning, while raising children who will see all people's needs as equally important as their own.
