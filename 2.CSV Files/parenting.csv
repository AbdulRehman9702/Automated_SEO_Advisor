She interviews the'Who's Who' in parenting and child development, using a framework that helps families to apply new ideas that fit with their own values. With 190+ episodes covering everything from how to get your kids to eat more vegetables, Why we shouldn't read the Your X-Year-Old Child books anymore, to various topics at the intersection of race and parenting, Your Parenting Mojo has been downloaded 3+ million times worldwide and has evolved to include workshops, ongoing memberships and more to support parents' needs, and children's learning and development. Jen's popular 10 week Taming Your Triggers workshop (opens in Spring and Autumn) helps parents figure out how to stop being triggered by their child's age appropriate behavior and parent from a place of calm, clarity and confidence. For those looking to bring many of the tools and strategies discussed in the podcast into their own home and families, Jen's Parenting Membership (opens in late Spring) helps parents support their child's development while also making parenting easier. And for those parents looking to support their children's intrinsic love of learning, Jen's Learning Membership (opens in Autumn) helps keep children's intrinsic curiosity and motivation intact. In September of 2023, in partnership with Sasquatch Books & Penguin Random House, Jen launched her first book - Parenting Beyond Power: How to Use Connection & Collaboration to Transform Your Family - And the World - that describes practical tools parents can use to raise children who will change the world tomorrow - while also making family life easier today. The book traces the ways that social forces like White supremacy (including racism), patriarchy, and capitalism have hurt us - and how we will pass those hurts on to our children unless we make a conscious decision to do something differently. The book shows step-by-step how to both understand and meet our children's needs and our own needs so we can all live fulfilled lives - making it easier to get out the door in the morning, while raising children who will see all people's needs as equally important as their own. Research-based ideas to help kids thrive.","2292","14293","","0","0","","0","","0","","0","","0","","0","","","","","","","","","","","","237531","28100","1190","174","6.839","86.359","Easy","2.817","0","0","","0","0","0","0.000","39","21","0","4","4","0","","","","","845fd9d959e11d79caae3123d3e4f955","1.034","Fri, 29 Nov 2024 02:12:44 GMT","","","","1.1","https://yourparentingmojo.com/","2024-11-30 15:20:55"
