Our program combines chemistry, physics, advanced mathematics, statistics, geology, and core engineering science to prepare graduates for the workforce. Being a civil engineer means working on designing, building and maintaining our environment including public works like roads, bridges, airports, canals, dams and buildings. Being a professional Civil Engineer can also involve conducting research to help create more sustainable and efficient materials and building methods.","504","3135","","0","0","","0","What is Civil Engineering?","26","","0","Breadcrumb","10","Main navigation","15","","","","","https://scse.d.umn.edu/about/departments-and-programs/civil-engineering-department/what-civil-engineering","","","","","","207611","37423","1980","475","4.168","66.774","Normal","9.089","0","3","","5","1","0","1.080","705","365","0","7","5","0","","","","","4e3e3cb3a687190b0a02b59a467d04c8","1.920","Wed, 27 Nov 2024 21:26:25 GMT","","","","1.1","https://scse.d.umn.edu/about/departments-and-programs/civil-engineering-department/what-civil-engineering","2024-11-30 14:38:51"
