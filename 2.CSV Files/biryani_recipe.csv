The fragrant basmati rice pairs beautifully with marinated chicken cooked with onions, tomatoes, and spices like cumin, coriander, and cardamom. Adding saffron-infused milk and fresh herbs like mint and cilantro enhances the dish's depth and aroma. Pair it with a side of cooling raita, a fresh salad, or even some spicy pickles for a meal that's truly satisfying. Whether it's a family dinner or a special occasion, this biryani recipe will impress every time. You can also customise it with vegetables or make it extra rich by adding fried nuts.

1. Biryani masala: in a med-high pan, for 2 mins, toast 1 stick cinnamon, 1tsp fennel, 1tsp coriander, 2 star anise, 1tsp clove, 6 cardamom pods, 2tsp cumin, 1tsp black pepper, 1 nutmeg - then grind into a powder, leave nutmeg aside
2. Finley slice 5 onions / shallots. Add to pan, cover with neutral oil and fry at med heat till caramelised ~25 mins. Strain, set aside, salt and reserve onion oil 
3. Add 4 halved chicken thighs and drums to a bowl
4. Season with: 400g plain yogurt, 1tsp biryani masala, 1.5tsp Kashmiri chilli powder, 1tsp turmeric, 1tsp garam masala, sea salt + black pepp, 3 cloves grated garlic, knob of grated ginger, dash grated nutmeg, 2 chopped green chillis, 1 diced tomato, handful fried onions, 1tbsp onion oil, bay leaf, coriander, juice of 1 lemon
5. Mix and marinate overnight!
6. Lace hot pan with ghee and par cook chicken then set aside. You just want a nice char all round 
7. Par cook rice: wash 500g aged basmati rice till water runs almost clear (I used @tildarice ) then add to boiling water with some whole spices and bay - cook for 2 mins, strain and cool 
8. Assemble biryani in layers: onion oil, rice, pinch of masala, chicken thigh + marinade, parsley, ghee, toasted cashews, fried onions - repeat for 3 layers and place drumsticks on top 
9. Pour over 4tbsp of saffron infused milk, then seal with a lid or use a rolled sheet of puff pastry 
10. Carefully brush puff pastry with egg wash (1 yolk + 1tbsp whole milk) then sprinkle over black sesame and cumin 
11. Bake at 165c for 30-40 mins, let rest for 15, then serve 
12. Raita: 500g yogurt, 1 grated cucumber with water squeezed out, 1/2 diced red onion, coriander, salt, pepp, cumin, masala 
-
A lot of ingredients in here so it can seem overwhelming, but the result is one of the most flavoursome and comforting rice dishes. Adjust the quantities to your liking #notoriousfoodie 🙅🏽‍♂️
