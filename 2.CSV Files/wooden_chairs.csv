Wooden Chair is a modern, innovative seat, yet it is also warm, cosy and comfortable. The structure, made of oiled natural solid beech wood, is fluid and continuous, almost organic. The beech wood planks, bent with hot steam to form a double curve, are supported by two horizontal reinforcements: 2 at the ends and 3 in the seat area, all fastened with visible screws.
